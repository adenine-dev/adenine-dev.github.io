It should showcase the very best of my work and serve as a
          way for people to find me. I wanted it to show all the things I love about front end web development</p></div><div><h2>Design</h2><p>I love weird little interactions on websites. So I wanted to incorperate several of these into my site without it feeling overwhelming.
          I also wanted the first thing everyone sees to be a big flashy animation, followed by a little demo of a micro-interaction. This lead to the floating codeblocks 
          concept which I originally intended to be easily editable, however when this was implemented I found it somewhat tacky. So I went with a simple paralax effect instead.
          Next was the about section. This section has always bored me to death. So I kept it as brief as possible while still incorporating my ethos. Then because that seemed too heavy 
          I also added a blithe comment about how little sleep I get. The animation I am exteremely happy with. My start in javascript was little canvas expirements so it felt only fitting to 
          pay homage to that origin.</p></div></section></body></html>
