Because several friends and I are unsatisfied with all products we were able to find, I decided to make my own.</p><div><h2>Goals of this project</h2><p>My primary goal of this project was to create a service. Before doing this
          project I knew all the theory about creating an application however I did not know 
          many of the intricacies of building out a real application with actual users.
          Because I made this while in school my time was limited, and while this is still very 
          much an ongoing project it has taught me a lot about creating a production ready application.</p></div><div><h2>Design</h2><p>fuck all dis shit heck dog</p></div></section></body></html>
